== Battery Capacity Checker

Discharge 2 Li-Ion cells from >4.1V voltage to 2.5V while recording the discharge 
profile and cell capacity. Discharge process can be started by pressing a momentary
push button switch. A red LED lights up to indicate that the discharge process is
still continuing (2.5V cut off has not been reached).
